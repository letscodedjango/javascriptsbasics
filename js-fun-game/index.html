<!-- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language;
it is a markup language used to tell your browser how to structure the web pages you visit.
It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wishes it to be.
HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap,
or mark up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way. -->

  <h1> This time exploring another technology ie. JS</h1>
  <p> Here we will be focusing on HTML with JS so that we can have interactive website</p>
  <h2>What actually Javascript is? Does it have anything with Java?</h2>
  <p>Javascript has nothing to do with Java. So dont get confuse. Both are complete different from each other and used for different purposes.</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Javascript is a lightweight, cross-platform, object-oriented programming language</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Javascript is one of the three (HTML/CSS) core technologies of any web development.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Earlier, Javascript was used as a client side language but thanks to node.js, we can use javascript on server side too.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
 <p>Javascript make the web appliaction dynamic and interactive. We can interact with our browser/web appliaction using Javascript</p>
